val load :
  ?batch:bool -> ?silent:silent -> ?force:bool ->
  ?incs:bool -> ?init:bool -> ?dir:fpath -> string -> bool
(** [load ~batch ~silent ~force ~deps ~incs ~init ~dir "M"] loads module [M]
    and returns [true] if the load was successful; init files may however
    have failed to load. The exact side effects of this function are
    described {{!loadsem}here}. The optional parameters are as follows:
    {ul
    {- [batch] if [true] alternative load sequences error rather than
       interactively ask to select one. Defaults to
       [not !]{!Sys.interactive}.}
    {- [silent] if [`All] nothing is logged except errors. If [`Loads]
       then load sequences are not logged but other diagnostic messages
       may be logged. If [`No] both load sequences and diagnostic messages
       are logged. Defaults to [`No].}
    {- [force] if [true] force the reload of objects. Defaults to [false].}
    {- [incs] if [true] directory includes should be added. Defaults
       to [true]. See load {{!loadsem}semantics} for details.}
    {- [init] if [true] toplevel init files should be loaded,
       see the load {{!loadsem}semantics}. Defaults to [true].}
    {- [dir] is currently ignored.}}

    The full syntax for specifying the module to load is:
{v [PKG.]M(@VARIANT)* v}
    {ul
    {- [M] is always the top level (compilation unit) module name to load.}
    {- [PKG] constrains [M] to be found in package [PKG]. Packages
       names are the name of directories just below omod's library
       directory (see [omod conf], and [omod pkg] for a list).}
    {- [@VARIANT] (repeatable) indicates that all ambiguities should be resolved
       according to variant [VARIANT]. This means that if an object
       can be found in multiple directories in a package directory
       [P], the one that is rooted in the hierarchy starting at [P/VARIANT]
       or [P/@VARIANT] will be selected. If no ambiguity arises the parameter
       is ignored. See the {{!tutorial}tutorial} for an example.}} *)

(** {1:tutorial Tutorial}

    To use the toplevel helpers simply bring the [Omod] module
    in your scope: type or add the following line to your
    [~/.ocamlinit] file.
{[#use "omod.top"]}

    If you are using [ocamlnat] you
    {{:https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7589}unfortunately} need to
    [#use] another file:
{[#use "omod.nattop"]}
    It is also likely that [opam]'s initialization bits in [.ocamlinit] to
    find the file to [#use] won't work. So you need to invoke
    [ocamlnat] with [-noinit] and indicate where the file to [#use] can
    be found. The following invocation should work:
{[
rlwrap ocamlnat -I $OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH -noinit
]}
    Now whenever you want to use a module named [M] invoke:
{[# Omod.load "M"]}
    This will recursively load its dependencies and toplevel init files.
    See {!load} for more options and details.

    If you are using [omod] in scripts you should also specify the
    package [PKG] where [M] should be found using the [PKG.M]
    syntax. This because a further package install could also install
    a module [M] resulting in a load ambiguity and your script no longer
    working.

    If you run into multiple load sequence resolutions, [Omod]
    interactively asks to choose one of the possible
    sequences. Assuming you have the package [ptime] installed this is
    an example:
{[
# Omod.load "Ptime_clock"
]}
    since [ptime] provides an [os] clock for your operating
    system and a [jsoo] clock for your browser.

    The ambiguity can be automatically resolved by specifying the
    variant you want explicitly (see {!load} for details) for example
    to directly request the OS clock you should issue:
{[
# Omod.load "Ptime_clock\@os"
]}
    In a script it would even be better to write:
{[
# Omod.load "ptime.Ptime_clock\@os"
]}

   Finally to list what was loaded by [Omod] type:
{[
# Omod.status ()
]}
   For information about how [Omod] locates packages,
   consult [omod conf --help].

    {1:loadsem Load semantics and effects}

    {ul

    {- Loading an object means: load its dependencies,
       add its containing directory to the
       included directories (if [incs] is [true]), load the actual object
       and finally load its toplevel init file (if [init] is [true] and the
       file exists, see below).}
    {- The {e toplevel init file} of an object with basename [o] is a file
       called [o_top_init.ml] in the same directory as the object.}
    {- If an object is available both as a standalone file ([cmo], [cmx])
       and in a library archive ([cma], [cmxs]), [Omod] favours loading the
       library archive.}
    {- If an interface dependency cannot be resolved to an implementation
       but does resolve to a compiled interface, the dependency
       is assumed to be a mli-only compilation unit and the directory
       of the compiled interface is added to the includes (if [incs] is true).}
    {- The initialization performed by [omod.top] and [omod.nattop]
       {{!assume_load}assume} (with [incs:false] and [init:false])
       the following modules:
       {ul
       {- [utop.UTop] if [omod.top] is [#use]d in [utop]. }
       {- [ocaml.Toploop] if [omod.top] is [#use]d (not in [utop]).}
       {- [ocaml.Opttoploop] if [omod.nattop] is [#use]d. .}}}
    {- Load sequences with [vmthread] variants and objects
       of the form [m.p.ext] (profiling versions in the stdlib)
       are excluded from load sequence results. This reduces the load
       sequence from multiple occurrences to a single candidate on many
       modules.}
    {- For [ocamlnat] dependency analysis is made on [cmx] and [cmxa] files,
       the suffixes of resulting objects is then mapped to [cmxs]. This
       assumes the corresponding files exist and their objects
       match.}} *)

(*
    {2:localsearch Local search}

    Some functions take a [~dir] argument that specifies a directory
    where objects can be looked up in addition to packages.  This
    directory defaults to [_build] or the value of the environment
    value [ODIG_TOP_LOCAL_DIR]. These load functions always first look up
    for objects locally and then in packages.
