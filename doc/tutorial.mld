{0 Omod tutorial}

To use the toplevel helpers simply bring the [Omod] module
in your scope: type or add the following line to your
[~/.ocamlinit] file.

{v #use "omod.top" v}

Now whenever you want to use a module named [M] invoke:

{[# Omod.load "M"]}

This will recursively load its dependencies and toplevel init files.
See {!Omod.load} for more options and details.

If you are using [omod] in scripts you should also specify the package
[PKG] where [M] should be found using the [PKG.M] syntax. This because
a further package install could also install a module [M] resulting in
a load ambiguity and your script no longer working.

If you run into multiple load sequence resolutions, [Omod]
interactively asks to choose one of the possible sequences. Assuming
you have the package [ptime] installed this is an example ({b note}
[ptime] will switch to a different technique which doesn't need
library variants for the [js_of_ocaml] support, so the following may
no longer be a good or working example in the future) :

{[
# Omod.load "Ptime_clock"
]}

since [ptime] provides an [os] clock for your operating
system and a [jsoo] clock for your browser.

The ambiguity can be automatically resolved by specifying the
variant you want explicitly (see {!Omod.load} for details) for example
to directly request the OS clock you should issue:

{[
# Omod.load "Ptime_clock@clock/os"
]}

In a script it would even be better to write:

{[
# Omod.load "ptime.Ptime_clock@clock/os"
]}

Finally to list what was loaded by [Omod] type:

{[
# Omod.status ()
]}

For information about how [Omod] locates packages, consult
[omod conf --help].
